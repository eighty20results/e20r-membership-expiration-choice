Stable tag: 1.0

Adds a membership level setting to configure how PMPro will handle member cancellations.

== Description ==

By default, PMPro terminates the user's access to protected content immediately. This plugin will configure the membership to end at the end
of the currently paid-for membership period by default. However, it's possible to change this default to "immediately"
on a per-membership level basis via the Membership Level settings.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `e20r-member-cancellation-policy` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Edit your membership levels and set the Membership Cancellation Policy option for each level.
